Gobolino
========


Gobolino tries to be a decent, full featured docker gui with almost zero configuration and dependencies.

Easy to launch in a python virtual environment, it wants to provide full control over all docker functionalities with the ease of use that only a gui can provide.



Gobolino is under heavy development rigth now so functionality is expect to change quickly.
